# ProVision-Takehome

Assumptions:

I wasn't sure based on the description what was intended, but given the time constraint I decided to implemented a static list of programs to version check, not a list generated based on the user's machine.

If I was to build out a dynamic list I'd get a list of currently running or installed programs and then check their version numbers, the list would be quite large so some filtering would be nice. I would also need to check the operating system of the host machine and build a different set of CliWrap commands for each. Sounds fun but would take me over the time limit!
