# ProVision-Takehome

Assumptions

- I wasn't sure based on the description what was intended, but given the time constraint I decided to implemented a static list of programs to version check, not a list generated based on the user's machine.

We could get a list of currently running or installed programs and then check their version numbers, but the list would be quite large or require filtering and implementing that functionality would need to account for different operating system's commandline tools.
